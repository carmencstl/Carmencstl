Hi there! I'm Carmen, a programming student at 42 Málaga. 💻📚 For the past year, I've been self-taught in various technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I'm immersing myself in learning C, a powerful and versatile programming language.

I'm passionate about programming and enjoy every moment I spend on it. I love solving problems and creating creative solutions, and I firmly believe that programming can help change the world in a positive way. 🌎💪

In addition to my passion for programming, I'm also passionate about interface design. I enjoy creating attractive, intuitive, and user-friendly interfaces that provide an excellent user experience. 🎨👨‍💻

Currently, I intend to learn how to use Figma professionally. I believe that Figma is a powerful tool for interface design, and I'm interested in learning how to use it to create high-quality designs that are easy to implement in applications and websites. 🎨👨‍💻

I believe that the ability to design and develop an application from start to finish is a valuable skill, and I'm excited to learn new tools and technologies to improve my skills in interface design and programming. If you have any tips or resources for learning Figma, I'd love to hear them! 💡💻

I believe that the combination of programming and interface design skills can lead to the creation of incredible products, and I'm committed to continuing to develop my skills in both fields. On my GitHub profile, you'll find some projects I've worked on, both from a programming and design perspective. I hope you enjoy seeing them as much as I enjoyed creating them! 😊💻
